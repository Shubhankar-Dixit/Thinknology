# Thinknology - Ethical Technology Exploration

## Project Overview
Thinknology is an interactive storytelling website that explores ethical dilemmas arising from cutting-edge technologies. The site guides visitors through complex topics with clarity and thoughtfulness, inviting reflection and participation.

## Design Philosophy
- **Aesthetic**: Warm, inviting, earthy tones (beiges, soft browns, creams, blackish browns)
- **Brand Symbol**: Owl illustration representing wisdom and curiosity
- **User Experience**: Smooth scrolling, gentle animations, calming and educational
- **Typography**: Mix of classic serif fonts for traditional wisdom and modern sans-serif for contemporary perspectives

## Key Features
1. **Interactive Storytelling**: Narrative-driven exploration of ethical dilemmas
2. **Educational Sections**: Clear explanations of technologies like AI, IVF, and cloning
3. **Interactive Demos**: Visual demonstrations of how technologies work (to be implemented)
4. **Ethical Voting**: User participation in deciding whether technologies are ethical
5. **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across all devices

## Technology Topics
1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
2. In Vitro Fertilization and Genetic Selection
3. Cloning and Genetic Engineering
4. Brain-Computer Interfaces (future)
5. Life Extension Technologies (future)

## Development Notes
- Focus on smooth scroll animations and transitions
- Ensure accessibility for all users
- Design for thoughtful engagement rather than quick consumption
- Plan for future interactive demos that will allow hands-on exploration
- Consider adding a discussion forum in future iterations
